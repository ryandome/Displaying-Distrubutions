     A distribution is a chart or function that displays all of the values for a given variable and their frequencies or relative frequencies. Frequency is expressed as how often a variable occurs, the relative frequency is expressed by either a proportion or a percentage. The main elements of a distribution include the level, the spread, the shape, and outliers.

    The level of a distribution includes measures of central tendency like mean, median, and mode. If the data is normally distributed both the mean and median will tell us where the majority of the data located. When the data is skewed to either side the median becomes a better estimate of where most of the data is located because it is more resistant to outliers.

       Another important element of any distribution is the spread. A measure of the spread is the range. The range of a distribution is the difference between its minimum and maximum values. You can also look at the spread by finding the standard deviation. The higher the standard deviation the closer values are to the mean, when the standard deviation is low values are farther from the mean.

      To find the shape of a distribution you need to create a histogram. The histogram will tell show you whether it is normally distributed where the mean equal to the median, right skewed where a majority of the values are small and the mean is greater than the median, or left skewed where a majority of the values are large and the mean is less than the median.

       Another element of a distribution are the outliers. to find outliers you can find the Interquartile Range (IQR) this is difference between the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles for your data. Any value that is beyond 1.5 times the IQR over Q3 or below Q1 is considered an outlier. Outliers help us to better understand the shape. The mean is pulled toward the outliers causing the distrubution to be skewed.
